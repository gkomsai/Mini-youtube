YOUTUBE MINI APP I
Create a Navbar that looks exactly like Youtube.
In the search box of the navbar, the user should be able to search for videos.
Show the search results in a grid format, exactly as Youtube.com shows.
Show 20 results for each video.
Please note, search results should be thumbnails not the videos itself.
When a user clicks on any thumbnail, take them to a new page where they can actually see the video. Use iframe embed code to show video. Use ES6 throughout.
